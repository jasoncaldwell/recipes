* 1 coffee mug Semolina flour
* a good pinch of salt

Kneed it all together for at least 15 min.

Roll out thin and add all the deliciousness that you like on it. Cook it in the oven at the highest possible temp. for about 10 - 15 minutes. and enjoy with a good Italian red wine.

Pro-tip. invest in a pizza stone for your oven. It makes is so much better and it is great for all kinds of bread.

Great suggestion for topping: a little bit of olive oil (you can add garlic to the oil if you like), super thinly sliced potatoes, a tiny bit of Rosemary, a bit of fresh mozzarella cheese and a little salt.

I'm always happy to talk cooking. I'm not a great chef but I grew up in a house where everyone had to cook :)

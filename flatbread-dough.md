# Flatbread Dough

## Dry Ingredients
* 1 3/4 cup of flour
* A little salt

## Wet Ingredients
* 1 package of active yeast
* A little sugar
* 3/4 cup of very warm water (110 degrees - not hot)

## Directions

Put salt and flour into food processor and pulse a few times to combine

Stir wet ingredients together and let sit for 10-15 minutes. It should froth up a bit. This will let you know the yeast has fully activated.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and process into a ball. Add more flour if needed. Can also add some olive oil.

Shape into 2 balls.

Use immediately or let rise for an hour in a bowl coated with a thin layer of olive oil, punch down and spred out into a pan liberally coated with olive oil.

Don't overload the ingredients. I typically brush on a thin layer of plain or garlic/rosemary infused olive oil then lay out ingredients then put a thin layer of cheese.

Cook this at 500 in a well preheadet oven. In my kitchen this turns out crispy and best on the back of a black baking sheet.

Once you have the dough balls, you can cover with olive oil and plastic wrap and then refrigerate for a few days or freeze for a few months. To use the frozen dough: place in the refridgerator overnight then on the counter for an hour.

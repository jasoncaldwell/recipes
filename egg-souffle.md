# Egg Souffle

## Ingredients

* 3/4 c flour
* 1 1/2 t baking powder
* 15 eggs
* 1 c (2 sticks) butter, melted (I just nuke it and let it cool for at least 5 min)
* 1 c ricotta
* 1 c. sour cream
* 1/4 - 1/3 c. heavy cream
* 1 1/2 lbs. gruyere cheese shredded - (I use anything around but gruyere works really well - I usually will do COMTE from trader joe's mixed with shredded cheddar and some grated parm too - (it's cheaper and more buttery in taste)
* 3/4 t salt
* 1 t ground black pepper
* 1 1/4 c chopped basil
* 1 bunch chives

preheat ovem to 350 degrees F
Place flour, baking powder, eggs, and melted butter in a bowl and blend with an electric mixer, blend well. Add everything else except chives and blend well

Pour into a buttered casserole 9x13. Sprinkle chives over top.

Bake 40 minutes or until center is set - I test it like I do brownies. You'll also be able to see if it's done on the bottom if you use a glass baking dish. Also they say serve at room temp but I prefer hot - the beauty is that it CAN be served at room temp so you can leave it out for hours which is great for a party!!!!
